body:

[John Horton Conway](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/) died on 11 April 2020. I found out about this sad news via [SMBC](http://smbc-comics.com/comic/life-2). [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2293/) also has a clever tribute.
Prolific in many branches of mathematics, Conway was a professor at both Princeton University and Cambridge. Despite having an Erd√∂s number of one, he is arguably most famous for his cellular automaton, [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 
 
Some years ago Google made an Easter Egg celebrating Conway's cellular automaton; enter "Conway's Game of Life" in a Google search box to see pale blue cellular patterns emerging from the side of your browser's screen.
