title: Vignette Content Agency
---
body: This site started out as a simple landing page and contact form for [Vignette](https://vignette.agency/). The site was originally made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the contact form implemented with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). (Formspree is an excellent contact form solution for static sites.) The site has since evolved into a photographic portfolio site, built with a Python-based Static Content Management System [(Lektor)](https://www.getlektor.com/) and the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS Framework. Deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

summary: Hugo landing page deployed via Netlify.
