title: Vignette Content Agency
---
body:

This site started out as a simple landing page and contact form for [Vignette Content Agency](https://vignette.agency/), made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The contact form was implemented with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). (Formspree is an excellent contact form solution for static sites.) The site has since evolved into a photographic portfolio site, constructed with a Python-based Static Content Management System [(Lektor)](https://www.getlektor.com/) and the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS Framework. The whole shebang is built and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Thank you to W3Bits for the [CSS Flexbox masonry layout tutorial](https://w3bits.com/flexbox-masonry/).

Update - now using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to optimize and serve the site images in modern file formats (AVIF, WebP, etc.). The site is still deployed via Netlify, but the images are hosted and optimized on Cloudinary's CDN, as per this [tutorial](https://spacejelly.dev/posts/how-to-optimize-images-on-netlify-with-the-cloudinary-build-plugin/).
